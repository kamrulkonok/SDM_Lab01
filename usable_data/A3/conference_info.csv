However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100% of the parameters per task.",2019,2453,"2815290, 1911881, 40569328, 68973833, 51985388, 2813347, 2809991, 1802148",2815290,Nicosia,2,"50052368, 115300694",Y,"In the videos, it seems like the robot could get a slightly better view if it took another couple of steps.;Algorithm 1 does not make clear the relationship between the model learned in step 2 and the algorithms in steps 4 to 6.",International Conference on Machine Learning,19,"task,parameters,transfer,nlp,NLP"

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.",2019,2113,"2268272, 47079359, 143753639",2268272,Bratislava,3,"38608914, 2285816475, 2109716565",Y,"1.

To address this question, we first introduce Super-NaturalInstructions, a benchmark of 1,616 diverse NLP tasks and their expert-written instructions. Our collection covers 76 distinct task types, including but not limited to classification, extraction, infilling, sequence tagging, text rewriting, and text composition. This large and diverse collection of tasks enables rigorous benchmarking of cross-task generalization under instructions—training models to follow instructions on a subset of tasks and evaluating them on the remaining unseen ones.Furthermore, we build Tk-Instruct, a transformer model trained to follow a variety of in-context instructions (plain language task definitions or k-shot examples). Our experiments show that Tk-Instruct outperforms existing instruction-following models such as InstructGPT by over 9% on our benchmark despite being an order of magnitude smaller. We further analyze generalization as a function of various scaling parameters, such as the number of observed tasks, the number of instances per task, and model sizes.

Our work develops new methods to (1) measure media biases in LMs trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks.

Since existing solvers achieve high performance on the benchmark datasets for elementary level MWPs containing one-unknown arithmetic word problems, such problems are often considered “solved” with the bulk of research attention moving to more complex MWPs. In this paper, we restrict our attention to English MWPs taught in grades four and lower. We provide strong evidence that the existing MWP solvers rely on shallow heuristics to achieve high performance on the benchmark datasets. To this end, we show that MWP solvers that do not have access to the question asked in the MWP can still solve a large fraction of MWPs. Similarly, models that treat MWPs as bag-of-words can also achieve surprisingly high accuracy. Further, we introduce a challenge dataset, SVAMP, created by applying carefully chosen variations over examples sampled from existing datasets. The best accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art models is substantially lower on SVAMP, thus showing that much remains to be done even for the simplest of the MWPs.",2021,385,"1443788809, 92954142, 144260125",1443788809,Dublin,3,"2805081, 2146671969, 2328103",Y,"If this is not the case for some reason, more detailed explanation is needed.;6.

Inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering, we introduce CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology for testing NLP models. CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models.

Based on these findings, we describe the beginnings of a path forward by proposing three recommendations that should guide work analyzing “bias” in NLP systems. These recommendations rest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to articulate their conceptualizations of “bias”---i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning underlying these statements—and to center work around the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations between technologists and such communities.",2020,838,"3422038, 2881033, 2065041692, 1831395",3422038,Monaco,3,"2108724347, 9162688, 31347453",Y,Their abstract also claims to utilize a convex programming formulation.;Hence inferring a structured latent space is a challenge.;Follow up experiments extend the basic setup significantly.,Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,20,"bias,nlp,systems,papers,NLP"

This effectively hides all embedding-specific engineering complexity and allows researchers to “mix and match” various embeddings with little effort. The framework also implements standard model training and hyperparameter selection routines, as well as a data fetching module that can download publicly available NLP datasets and convert them into data structures for quick set up of experiments.

We define universal adversarial triggers: input-agnostic sequences of tokens that trigger a model to produce a specific prediction when concatenated to any input from a dataset. We propose a gradient-guided search over tokens which finds short trigger sequences (e.g., one word for classification and four words for language modeling) that successfully trigger the target prediction. For example, triggers cause SNLI entailment accuracy to drop from 89.94% to 0.55%, 72% of “why” questions in SQuAD to be answered “to kill american people”, and the GPT-2 language model to spew racist output even when conditioned on non-racial contexts. Furthermore, although the triggers are optimized using white-box access to a specific model, they transfer to other models for all tasks we consider. Finally, since triggers are input-agnostic, they provide an analysis of global model behavior. For instance, they confirm that SNLI models exploit dataset biases and help to diagnose heuristics learned by reading comprehension models.",2019,625,"145217343, 2113511266, 1380266797, 40642935, 34650964",145217343,Vaduz,3,"1864353, 1830383266, 47149500",Y,"How much can change between the goal images and the environment before the system fails?;What is LSS in figure 4?;The WAGE parameters (i.e., the quantized no. of bits used) are 2-8-8-8, respectively.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,19,"model,triggers,models,nlp,NLP"

The main idea is to bridge the gap between NLP downstream tasks and language modeling (LM), by mapping these tasks into natural language prompts, which are then filled by pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, for prompt learning, there are still two salient gaps between NLP tasks and pretraining. First, prompt information is not necessarily sufficiently present during LM pretraining. Second, task-specific data are not necessarily well represented during pretraining. We address these two issues by proposing AdaPrompt, adaptively retrieving external data for continual pretraining of PLMs by making use of both task and prompt characteristics. In addition, we make use of knowledge in Natural Language Inference models for deriving adaptive verbalizers.

The most commonly used cross entropy (CE) criteria is actually an accuracy-oriented objective, and thus creates a discrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, while at test time F1 score concerns more about positive examples. In this paper, we propose to use dice loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data-imbalanced NLP tasks. Dice loss is based on the Sørensen--Dice coefficient or Tversky index , which attaches similar importance to false positives and false negatives, and is more immune to the data-imbalance issue. To further alleviate the dominating influence from easy-negative examples in training, we propose to associate training examples with dynamically adjusted weights to deemphasize easy-negative examples. Theoretical analysis shows that this strategy narrows down the gap between the F1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training. With the proposed training objective, we observe significant performance boost on a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks.

Moreover, most prior work has emphasized bias along a single dimension such as gender or race. In this work, we benchmark multiple NLP models with regards to their fairness and predictive performance across a variety of NLP tasks. In particular, we assess intersectional bias - fairness across multiple demographic dimensions. The results show that while current debiasing strategies fare well in terms of the fairness-accuracy trade-off (generally preserving predictive power in debiased models), they are unable to effectively alleviate bias in downstream tasks.

Despite robustness being an increasingly studied topic, it has been separately explored in applications like vision and NLP, with various definitions, evaluation and mitigation strategies in multiple lines of research. In this paper, we aim to provide a unifying survey of how to define, measure and improve robustness in NLP.

However, recent methods for generating NLP adversarial examples involve combinatorial search and expensive sentence encoders for constraining the generated instances. As a result, it remains challenging to use vanilla adversarial training to improve NLP models' performance, and the benefits are mainly uninvestigated. This paper proposes a simple and improved vanilla adversarial training process for NLP models, which we name Attacking to Training (A2T). The core part of A2T is a new and cheaper word substitution attack optimized for vanilla adversarial training. We use A2T to train BERT and RoBERTa models on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp, and SNLI datasets. Our results empirically show that it is possible to train robust NLP models using a much cheaper adversary. We demonstrate that vanilla adversarial training with A2T can improve an NLP model's robustness to the attack it was originally trained with and also defend the model against other types of word substitution attacks. Furthermore, we show that A2T can improve NLP models' standard accuracy, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability.

A surprising degree of numeracy is naturally present in standard embeddings. For example, GloVe and word2vec accurately encode magnitude for numbers up to 1,000.

(ii) interpret relationships between multiple systems. (e.g. where does system A outperform system B? What if we combine systems A, B and C?) and (iii) examine prediction results closely (e.g. what are common errors made by multiple systems or in what contexts do particular errors occur?). So far, ExplainaBoard covers more than 400 systems, 50 datasets, 40 languages, and 12 tasks.

In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of the transferability between 33 NLP tasks across three broad classes of problems (text classification, question answering, and sequence labeling). Our results show that transfer learning is more beneficial than previously thought, especially when target task data is scarce, and can improve performance even when the source task is small or differs substantially from the target task (e.g., part-of-speech tagging transfers well to the DROP QA dataset). We also develop task embeddings that can be used to predict the most transferable source tasks for a given target task, and we validate their effectiveness in experiments controlled for source and target data size.

Meanwhile, DNN models have been shown to be vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. One such attack that has attracted a great deal of attention recently is the backdoor attack. Specifically, the adversary poisons the target model’s training set to mislead any input with an added secret trigger to a target class. Previous backdoor attacks predominantly focus on computer vision (CV) applications, such as image classification. In this paper, we perform a systematic investigation of backdoor attack on NLP models, and propose BadNL, a general NLP backdoor attack framework including novel attack methods. Specifically, we propose three methods to construct triggers, namely BadChar, BadWord, and BadSentence, including basic and semantic-preserving variants. Our attacks achieve an almost perfect attack success rate with a negligible effect on the original model’s utility. For instance, using the BadChar, our backdoor attack achieves a 98.9% attack success rate with yielding a utility improvement of 1.5% on the SST-5 dataset when only poisoning 3% of the original set.

Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19% and 88.94%.

Assuming a set of n workers, up to f being Byzantine, we ask how resilient can SGD be, without limiting the dimension, nor the size of the parameter space. We first show that no gradient aggregation rule based on a linear combination of the vectors proposed by the workers (i.e, current approaches) tolerates a single Byzantine failure. We then formulate a resilience property of the aggregation rule capturing the basic requirements to guarantee convergence despite f Byzantine workers.

In this work, we develop a principled framework to address data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning. Given a learning algorithm trained on $n$ data points to produce a predictor, we propose data Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to the predictor performance. Data Shapley value uniquely satisfies several natural properties of equitable data valuation. We develop Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods to efficiently estimate data Shapley values in practical settings where complex learning algorithms, including neural networks, are trained on large datasets. In addition to being equitable, extensive experiments across biomedical, image and synthetic data demonstrate that data Shapley has several other benefits: 1) it is more powerful than the popular leave-one-out or leverage score in providing insight on what data is more valuable for a given learning task; 2) low Shapley value data effectively capture outliers and corruptions; 3) high Shapley value data inform what type of new data to acquire to improve the predictor.",2019,515,"27316199, 145085305",27316199,Budapest,3,"1793506, 1702822, 2362078",Y,"Additional regularization terms are also added to encourage the model to encode longer term dependencies in its latent distributions.;The current analysis is too simple.;A particularly interesting question would be whether the proposed model actually is a direct GAN-based extension of IBFA, and if not then how does it differ.",International Conference on Machine Learning,19,"data,shapley,value,machine learning,Machine Learning"

In this paper, we provide evidence that the LLM's internal state can be used to reveal the truthfulness of statements. This includes both statements provided to the LLM, and statements that the LLM itself generates. Our approach is to train a classifier that outputs the probability that a statement is truthful, based on the hidden layer activations of the LLM as it reads or generates the statement. Experiments demonstrate that given a set of test sentences, of which half are true and half false, our trained classifier achieves an average of 71\% to 83\% accuracy labeling which sentences are true versus false, depending on the LLM base model. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between our classifier's performance and approaches based on the probability assigned to the sentence by the LLM. We show that while LLM-assigned sentence probability is related to sentence truthfulness, this probability is also dependent on sentence length and the frequencies of words in the sentence, resulting in our trained classifier providing a more reliable approach to detecting truthfulness, highlighting its potential to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated content and its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.",2023,102,"1746466, 144135485",1746466,Belgrade,2,"3011964, 1388622435",Y,"* Figure 2 seems like a test made to work for this method and does not add much to the paper.;For example, the authors claimed in Section 4.3 that the Stein gradient estimator is faster than other methods, but it is not clear as to why this is the case.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,23,"llm,sentence,probability,statements,LLM"

However, these models cannot accurately interpret images infused with text, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. Standard procedures for extracting information from images often involve learning a fixed set of query embeddings. These embeddings are designed to encapsulate image contexts and are later used as soft prompt inputs in LLMs. Yet, this process is limited to the token count, potentially curtailing the recognition of scenes with text-rich context. To improve upon them, the present study introduces BLIVA: an augmented version of InstructBLIP with Visual Assistant. BLIVA incorporates the query embeddings from InstructBLIP and also directly projects encoded patch embeddings into the LLM, a technique inspired by LLaVA. This approach assists the model to capture intricate details potentially missed during the query decoding process. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our model, BLIVA, significantly enhances performance in processing text-rich VQA benchmarks (up to 17.76% in OCR-VQA benchmark) and in undertaking general (not particularly text-rich) VQA benchmarks (up to 7.9% in Visual Spatial Reasoning benchmark), and achieved 17.72% overall improvement in a comprehensive multimodal LLM benchmark (MME), comparing to our baseline InstructBLIP. BLIVA demonstrates significant capability in decoding real-world images, irrespective of text presence.

One particularly demanding scenario is Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) which requires visual and natural language understanding as well as spatial and temporal reasoning capabilities. The embodied agent needs to ground its understanding of navigation instructions in observations of a real-world environment like Street View. Despite the impressive results of LLMs in other research areas, it is an ongoing problem of how to best connect them with an interactive visual environment. In this work, we propose VELMA, an embodied LLM agent that uses a verbalization of the trajectory and of visual environment observations as contextual prompt for the next action. Visual information is verbalized by a pipeline that extracts landmarks from the human written navigation instructions and uses CLIP to determine their visibility in the current panorama view. We show that VELMA is able to successfully follow navigation instructions in Street View with only two in-context examples.

This poses a growing risk of misuse of LLMs and demands the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. However, existing detectors lack robustness against attacks: they degrade detection accuracy by simply paraphrasing LLM-generated texts. Furthermore, a malicious user might attempt to deliberately evade the detectors based on detection results, but this has not been assumed in previous studies. In this paper, we propose OUTFOX, a framework that improves the robustness of LLM-generated-text detectors by allowing both the detector and the attacker to consider each other's output. In this framework, the attacker uses the detector's prediction labels as examples for in-context learning and adversarially generates essays that are harder to detect, while the detector uses the adversarially generated essays as examples for in-context learning to learn to detect essays from a strong attacker. Experiments in the domain of student essays show that the proposed detector improves the detection performance on the attacker-generated texts by up to +41.3 points F1-score. Furthermore, the proposed detector shows a state-of-the-art detection performance: up to 96.9 points F1-score, beating existing detectors on non-attacked texts.

Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) solutions are primarily integer-based and struggle with bit widths below 8 bits. Compared to integer quantization, floating-point (FP) quantization is more flexible and can better handle long-tail or bell-shaped distributions, and it has emerged as a default choice in many hardware platforms. One characteristic of FP quantization is that its performance largely depends on the choice of exponent bits and clipping range. In this regard, we construct a strong FP-PTQ baseline by searching for the optimal quantization parameters. Furthermore, we observe a high inter-channel variance and low intra-channel variance pattern in activation distributions, which adds activation quantization difficulty. We recognize this pattern to be consistent across a spectrum of transformer models designed for diverse tasks, such as LLMs, BERT, and Vision Transformer models. To tackle this, we propose per-channel activation quantization and show that these additional scaling factors can be reparameterized as exponential biases of weights, incurring a negligible cost. Our method, for the first time, can quantize both weights and activations in the LLaMA-13B to only 4-bit and achieves an average score of 63.1 on the common sense zero-shot reasoning tasks, which is only 5.8 lower than the full-precision model, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 12.7 points.

It has been a common practice for software engineers to consult LLMs when encountering coding questions. Although efforts have been made to avoid syntax errors and align the code with the intended semantics, the reliability, and robustness of the code generation from LLMs have not yet been thoroughly studied. The executable code is not equivalent to reliable and robust code, especially in the context of real-world software development. For example, the misuse of APIs in the generated code could lead to severe problems, such as resource leaks, program crashes, etc. Existing code evaluation benchmarks and datasets focus on crafting small tasks such as programming questions in coding interviews, which, however, deviates from the problem that developers would ask LLM for real-world coding help. To fill the missing piece, in this work, we propose a dataset RobustAPI for evaluating the reliability and robustness of code generated by LLMs. We collect 1208 coding questions from Stack Overflow on 18 representative Java APIs.

Long text could take long time to process, and thus may not be efficient enough for recommender systems that require immediate response. In LLM-based recommendation models, user and item IDs are usually filled in a template (i.e., discrete prompt) to allow the models to understand a given task, but the models usually need extensive fine-tuning to bridge the user/item IDs and the template words and to unleash the power of LLM for recommendation. To address the problems, we propose to distill the discrete prompt for a specific task to a set of continuous prompt vectors so as to bridge IDs and words and to reduce the inference time.

A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy.

We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks.

Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called ""perceptual losses""? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments.

We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset.

 The popular Q-learning algorithm is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions. It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.

However, as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with increasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the dataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this paper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which generalizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation scenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multikernel selection method for mean embedding matching.

In this paper, we empirically study this phenomenon in the setting of adversarially trained deep networks, which are trained to minimize the loss under worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that overfitting to the training set does in fact harm robust performance to a very large degree in adversarially robust training across multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) and perturbation models ($\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$). Based upon this observed effect, we show that the performance gains of virtually all recent algorithmic improvements upon adversarial training can be matched by simply using early stopping. We also show that effects such as the double descent curve do still occur in adversarially trained models, yet fail to explain the observed overfitting. Finally, we study several classical and modern deep learning remedies for overfitting, including regularization and data augmentation, and find that no approach in isolation improves significantly upon the gains achieved by early stopping.

It has been shown that the commonly used Cross Entropy (CE) loss is not robust to noisy labels. Whilst new loss functions have been designed, they are only partially robust. In this paper, we theoretically show by applying a simple normalization that: any loss can be made robust to noisy labels. However, in practice, simply being robust is not sufficient for a loss function to train accurate DNNs. By investigating several robust loss functions, we find that they suffer from a problem of underfitting. To address this, we propose a framework to build robust loss functions called Active Passive Loss (APL). APL combines two robust loss functions that mutually boost each other.

Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model.

 Neural networks are typically designed to deal with data in tensor forms. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture accepting graphs of arbitrary structure. Given a dataset containing graphs in the form of (G,y) where G is a graph and y is its class, we aim to develop neural networks that read the graphs directly and learn a classification function. There are two main challenges: 1) how to extract useful features characterizing the rich information encoded in a graph for classification purpose, and 2) how to sequentially read a graph in a meaningful and consistent order. To address the first challenge, we design a localized graph convolution model and show its connection with two graph kernels. To address the second challenge, we design a novel SortPooling layer which sorts graph vertices in a consistent order so that traditional neural networks can be trained on the graphs. Experiments on benchmark graph classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other graph neural network methods. Moreover, the architecture allows end-to-end gradient-based training with original graphs, without the need to first transform graphs into vectors.

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesizer explores a larger solution space, thus is optimal in a stronger sense. In addition, it reduces time and space complexity exponentially compared to some leading optimal approaches. The key to this success is a more efficient spacetime-based variable encoding of the layout synthesis problem as a mathematical programming problem. By slightly changing our formulation, we arrive at an approximate synthesizer that is even more efficient and outperforms some leading heuristic approaches, in terms of additional gate cost, by up to 100%, and also fidelity by up to 10x on a comprehensive set of benchmark programs and architectures. For a specific family of quantum programs named QAOA, which is deemed to be a promising application for near-term quantum computers, we further adjust the approximate synthesizer by taking commutation into consideration, achieving up to 75% reduction in depth and up to 65% reduction in additional cost compared to the tool used in a leading QAOA study.",2020,98,"2218979994, 2259796",2218979994,Chisinau,2,"2156120640, 2115626527",Y,"Across the two NLP tasks authors show that MNMS models trained simultaneously give better performance than hand tuned architectures.;Except from a few typos here and there, the paper is overall well-written.",2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference On Computer Aided Design (ICCAD),20,"quantum,programs,approaches,quantum computing,Quantum Computing"

However, the deployment of VQAs on contemporary NISQ devices often faces considerable system and time-dependant noise and prohibitively slow training speeds. On the other hand, the expensive supporting resources and infrastructure make quantum computers extremely keen on high utilization. In this paper, we propose a virtualized way of building up a quantum backend for variational quantum algorithms: rather than relying on a single physical device which tends to introduce ever-changing device-specific noise with less reliable performance as time-since-calibration grows, we propose to constitute a quantum ensemble, which dynamically distributes quantum tasks asynchronously across a set of physical devices, and adjusts the ensemble configuration with respect to machine status. In addition to reduced machine-dependant noise, the ensemble can provide significant speedups for VQA training. With this idea, we build a novel VQA training framework called EQC - a distributed gradient-based processor-performance-aware optimization system - that comprises: (i) a system architecture for asynchronous parallel VQA cooperative training; (ii) an analytical model for assessing the quality of a circuit output concerning its architecture, transpilation, and runtime conditions; (iii) a weighting mechanism to adjust the quantum ensemble's computational contribution according to the systems' current performance. Evaluations comprising 500K times' circuit evaluations across 10 IBMQ NISQ devices using a VQE and a QAOA applications demonstrate that EQC can attain error rates very close to the most performant device of the ensemble, while boosting the training speed by 10.5X on average (up to 86X and at least 5.2x).

To assure high quality of graph database engines, it is highly critical to conduct automatic test generation for graph database engines, e.g., random test generation, the most commonly adopted approach in practice. However, random test generation faces the challenge of generating complex inputs (i.e., property graphs and queries) for producing non-empty query results; generating such type of inputs is important especially for detecting wrong-result bugs. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose GDsmith, the first approach for testing Cypher graph database engines. GDsmith ensures that each randomly generated query satisfies the semantic requirements. To increase the probability of producing complex queries that return non-empty results, GDsmith includes two new techniques: graph-guided generation of complex pattern combinations and data-guided generation of complex conditions. Our evaluation results demonstrate that GDsmith is effective and efficient for producing complex queries that return non-empty results for bug detection, and substantially outperforms the baselines.

The core insight of this paper is that Query Partitioning, a test oracle that has been proposed to test Relational Database Systems, is applicable to testing GDBMSs as well. The core idea of Query Partitioning is that, given a query, multiple queries are derived whose results can be combined to reconstruct the given query’s result. Any discrepancy in the result indicates a logic bug. We have implemented this approach as a practical tool named GDBMeter and evaluated GDBMeter on three popular GDBMSs and found a total of 40 unique, previously unknown bugs. We consider 14 of them to be logic bugs, the others being error or crash bugs. Overall, 27 of the bugs have been fixed, and 35 confirmed. We compared our approach to the state-of-the-art approach to testing GDBMS, which relies on differential testing; we found that it results in a high number of false alarms, while Query Partitioning reported actual logic bugs without any false alarms.

These bugs are critical and can easily go unnoticed by developers when the graph and queries become complicated. Despite the importance of GDBs, logic bugs in GDBs have received less attention than those in relational database systems. In this paper, we present Grand, an approach for automatically finding logic bugs in GDBs that adopt Gremlin as their query language. The core idea of Grand is to construct semantically equivalent databases for multiple GDBs, and then compare the results of a Gremlin query on these databases. If the return results of a query on multiple GDBs are different, the likely cause is a logic bug in these GDBs. To effectively test GDBs, we propose a model-based query generation approach to generate valid Gremlin queries that can potentially return non-empty results, and a data mapping approach to unify the format of query results for different GDBs.

Network vulnerability assessment methods, a technology of active network security defense, have attracted many researchers. Most existing network vulnerability assessment methods store different types of data in different ways, which makes querying and analyzing inefficient, especially in the complex large-scale network environment. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a method of network vulnerability assessment based on graph database. The network host information, association relationship between hosts and vulnerability information of the target network are stored in the graph database, the query and analysis are carried out by using the graph database query language. Graph database stores the information of the network hosts, association relationship among hosts and vulnerabilities of the target network. The graph database query language supports querying and analysis. Visualizing the network topology, vulnerability information and all possible attack paths provides a reference to develop the network security protection strategy.

In this paper, an approach to storing and analyzing network performance data from a manufacturing factory workcell is introduced. A robotic testbed was constructed using two collaborative grade robot arms, machine emulators, and wireless communication devices. A graph database approach was implemented to capture network and operational event data among the components within the testbed. A schema is proposed, developed, and elaborated; a database is then populated with events from the testbed, and the resulting graph is presented. Query commands are then presented as a means to examine and analyze network performance and relationships within the components of the network.

The future of RDBMS certainly will be the Graph Databases with NoSql methodologies, which is emerging as beyond of relational model. In this paper, there is a need to highlight all the databases evolved after RDBMS. They couldn’t stay in market for so long period and survey has been made to highlight those databases after RDBMS. Relational Database Management System has certain advantages like (i) Storing in Tables, Column and Rows (ii) Data Storing in Normal Form (iii) Easy to use via SQL to retrieve information via complex join operators (iv) Maintainability via Reverse Engineering (v) Indexing and quick search. Due to these inherent features of RDBMS and SQL, it is necessary to explore and compare RDBMS with NoSQL methods to avoid complex join operation.

Physical database techniques are used to increase the performance of relational databases. Tablespaces also called subfolder is one of the physical database technique used by Oracle SQL database. Tablespaces are used to store the data logically in separate data files. Now-a-days huge amount and varied nature (unstructured and semi structured) of data is generated by the various organizations i.e., videos, images, blogs etc. This large amount of data is not handled by the SQL databases efficiently. NoSQL databases are used to process and analyze the large amount of data efficiently. Four different types of NoSQL databases are used in the industry according to the organization requirement.

Answering optional query clauses in SPARQL for instance renders the query evaluation problem immediately PSPACE-complete. Light-weight graph pattern matching relations, such as simulation, have recently been investigated as promising alternatives to more expensive query mechanisms like, e.g., computing subgraph isomorphism. Still, pattern matching alone lacks expressive query capabilities: graph patterns may be combined by usual inner joins. However, including more sophisticated operators is inevitable to make solutions more useful for emerging applications. In this paper we bridge this gap by introducing a new dual simulation process operating on SPARQL queries. In addition to supporting the full syntactic structure of SPARQL queries, it features polynomial-time pattern matching to compute an overapproximation of the query results. Moreover, to achieve running times competing with state-of-the-art database systems, we develop a novel algorithmic solution to dual simulation graph pattern matching, based on a system of inequalities that allows for several optimization heuristics. Finally, we achieve soundness of our process for SPARQL queries including UNION, AND and OPTIONAL operators not restricted to well-designed patterns.

This trend is fueled by the proliferation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML), where ML models usually transform unstructured data into feature vectors for data analytics, e.g., product recommendation. Existing systems and algorithms for managing vector data have two limitations: (1) They incur serious performance issue when handling large-scale and dynamic vector data; and (2) They provide limited functionalities that cannot meet the requirements of versatile applications. This paper presents Milvus, a purpose-built data management system to efficiently manage large-scale vector data. Milvus supports easy-to-use application interfaces (including SDKs and RESTful APIs); optimizes for the heterogeneous computing platform with modern CPUs and GPUs; enables advanced query processing beyond simple vector similarity search; handles dynamic data for fast updates while ensuring efficient query processing; and distributes data across multiple nodes to achieve scalability and availability. We first describe the design and implementation of Milvus. Then we demonstrate the real-world use cases supported by Milvus. In particular, we build a series of 10 applications (e.g., image/video search, chemical structure analysis, COVID-19 dataset search, personalized recommendation, biological multi-factor authentication, intelligent question answering) on top of Milvus. Finally, we experimentally evaluate Milvus with a wide range of systems including two open source systems (Vearch and Microsoft SPTAG) and three commercial systems. Experiments show that Milvus is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the competitors while providing more functionalities.

Data management systems are riding the wave by using GPUs to accelerate query execution, mainly for analytical workloads. However, this acceleration comes at the price of a slow interconnect which imposes strong restrictions in bandwidth and latency when bringing data from the main memory to the GPU for processing. The related research in data management systems mostly relies on late materialization and data sharing to mitigate the overheads introduced by slow interconnects even in the standard CPU processing case. Finally, workload trends move beyond analytical to fresh data processing, typically referred to as Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP). Therefore, we experience an evolution in three different axes: interconnect technology, GPU architecture, and workload characteristics. In this paper, we break the evolution of the technological landscape into steps and we study the applicability and performance of late materialization and data sharing in each one of them. We demonstrate that the standard PCIe interconnect substantially limits the performance of state-of-the-art GPUs and we propose a hybrid materialization approach which combines eager with lazy data transfers. Further, we show that the wide gap between GPU and PCIe throughput can be bridged through efﬁcient data sharing techniques.

However, traditional SCM mechanisms usually suffer from a wide scope of issues such as lack of information sharing, long delays for data retrieval, and unreliability in product tracing. Recent advances in blockchain technology show great potential to tackle these issues due to its salient features including immutability, transparency, and decentralization. Although there are some proof-of-concept studies and surveys on blockchain-based SCM from the perspective of logistics, the underlying technical challenges are not clearly identified.

Annotation projects for machine learning (ML) aim at minimizing human label variation, with the assumption to maximize data quality and in turn optimize and maximize machine learning metrics. However, thisconventional practice assumes that there exists a *ground truth*, and neglects that there exists genuine human variation in labeling due to disagreement, subjectivity in annotation or multiple plausible answers.In this position paper, we argue that this big open problem of human label variation persists and critically needs more attention to move our field forward. This is because human label variation impacts all stages of the ML pipeline: *data, modeling and evaluation*. However, few works consider all of these dimensions jointly; and existing research is fragmented. We reconcile different previously proposed notions of human label variation, provide a repository of publicly-available datasets with un-aggregated labels, depict approaches proposed so far, identify gaps and suggest ways forward.

While federated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for model training without requiring direct data sharing and exchange, effectively modeling the complex spatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting capabilities still remains an open problem. On the other hand, state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models assume unfettered access to the data, neglecting constraints on data sharing. To bridge this gap, we propose a federated spatio-temporal model -- Cross-Node Federated Graph Neural Network (CNFGNN) -- which explicitly encodes the underlying graph structure using graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture under the constraint of cross-node federated learning, which requires that data in a network of nodes is generated locally on each node and remains decentralized. CNFGNN operates by disentangling the temporal dynamics modeling on devices and spatial dynamics on the server, utilizing alternating optimization to reduce the communication cost, facilitating computations on the edge devices. Experiments on the traffic flow forecasting task show that CNFGNN achieves the best forecasting performance in both transductive and inductive learning settings with no extra computation cost on edge devices, while incurring modest communication cost.",2021,70,"27737939, 2267664, 47909531",27737939,Riga,3,"2837279, 1792647, 1720266",Y,"2.

Compared to previous systems, Spark SQL makes two main additions. First, it offers much tighter integration between relational and procedural processing, through a declarative DataFrame API that integrates with procedural Spark code. Second, it includes a highly extensible optimizer, Catalyst, built using features of the Scala programming language, that makes it easy to add composable rules, control code generation, and define extension points. Using Catalyst, we have built a variety of features (e.g. schema inference for JSON, machine learning types, and query federation to external databases) tailored for the complex needs of modern data analysis.

Matrix profile, the state-of-the-art algorithm to perform time series analysis, computes the most similar subsequence for a given query subsequence within a sliced time series. Matrix profile has low arithmetic intensity, but it typically operates on large amounts of time series data. In current computing systems, this data needs to be moved between the off-chip memory units and the on-chip computation units for performing matrix profile. This causes a major performance bottleneck as data movement is extremely costly in terms of both execution time and energy. In this work, we present NATSA, the first Near-Data Processing accelerator for time series analysis. The key idea is to exploit modern 3D-stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to enable efficient and fast specialized matrix profile computation near memory, where time series data resides. NATSA provides three key benefits: 1) quickly computing the matrix profile for a wide range of applications by building specialized energy-efficient floating-point arithmetic processing units close to HBM, 2) improving the energy efficiency and execution time by reducing the need for data movement over slow and energy-hungry buses between the computation units and the memory units, and 3) analyzing time series data at scale by exploiting low-latency, high-bandwidth, and energy-efficient memory access provided by HBM. Our experimental evaluation shows that NATSA improves performance by up to 14.2× (9.9× on average) and reduces energy by up to 27.2 × (19.4 × on average), over the state-of-the-art multi-core implementation.

Being a fundamental component in training and inference, data processing has not been systematically considered in pose estimation community, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we focus on this problem and find that the devil of top-down pose estimator is in the biased data processing. Specifically, by investigating the standard data processing in state-of-the-art approaches mainly including data transformation and encoding-decoding, we find that the results obtained by common flipping strategy are unaligned with the original ones in inference. Moreover, there is statistical error in standard encoding-decoding during both training and inference. Two problems couple together and significantly degrade the pose estimation performance. Based on quantitative analyses, we then formulate a principled way to tackle this dilemma. Data is processed in continuous space based on unit length (the intervals between pixels) instead of in discrete space with pixel, and a combined classification and regression approach is adopted to perform encoding-decoding. The Unbiased Data Processing (UDP) for human pose estimation can be achieved by combining the two together. UDP not only boosts the performance of existing methods by a large margin but also plays a important role in result reproducing and future exploration. As a model-agnostic approach, UDP promotes SimpleBaseline-ResNet50-256x192 by 1.5 AP (70.2 to 71.7) and HRNet-W32-256x192 by 1.7 AP (73.5 to 75.2) on COCO test-dev set.

To process real-world datasets, modern data-parallel systems often require extremely large amounts of memory, which are both costly and energy-inefficient. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies offers high capacity compared to DRAM and low energy compared to SSDs. Hence, NVMs have the potential to fundamentally change the dichotomy between DRAM and durable storage in Big Data processing. However, most Big Data applications are written in managed languages (e.g., Scala and Java) and executed on top of a managed runtime (e.g., the Java Virtual Machine) that already performs various dimensions of memory management. Supporting hybrid physical memories adds in a new dimension, creating unique challenges in data replacement and migration. This paper proposes Panthera, a semantics-aware, fully automated memory management technique for Big Data processing over hybrid memories. Panthera analyzes user programs on a Big Data system to infer their coarse-grained access patterns, which are then passed down to the Panthera runtime for efficient data placement and migration. For Big Data applications, the coarse-grained data division is accurate enough to guide GC for data layout, which hardly incurs data monitoring and moving overhead.

While first initiatives try to compare the systems for simple workloads, there is a clear gap of detailed analyses of the systems' performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework for benchmarking distributed stream processing engines. We use our suite to evaluate the performance of three widely used SDPSs in detail, namely Apache Storm, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. Our evaluation focuses in particular on measuring the throughput and latency of windowed operations, which are the basic type of operations in stream analytics. For this benchmark, we design workloads based on real-life, industrial use-cases inspired by the online gaming industry. The contribution of our work is threefold. First, we give a definition of latency and throughput for stateful operators.

Some applications, such as tracking, can use sensed acceleration and rate of rotation to calculate displacement based on physical system models. Other applications, such as activity recognition, extract manually designed features from sensor inputs for classification. Such applications face two challenges. On one hand, on-device sensor measurements are noisy. For many mobile applications, it is hard to find a distribution that exactly describes the noise in practice. Unfortunately, calculating target quantities based on physical system and noise models is only as accurate as the noise assumptions. Similarly, in classification applications, although manually designed features have proven to be effective, it is not always straightforward to find the most robust features to accommodate diverse sensor noise patterns and heterogeneous user behaviors. To this end, we propose DeepSense, a deep learning framework that directly addresses the aforementioned noise and feature customization challenges in a unified manner. DeepSense integrates convolutional and recurrent neural networks to exploit local interactions among similar mobile sensors, merge local interactions of different sensory modalities into global interactions, and extract temporal relationships to model signal dynamics. DeepSense thus provides a general signal estimation and classification framework that accommodates a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepSense using three representative and challenging tasks: car tracking with motion sensors, heterogeneous human activity recognition, and user identification with biometric motion analysis. DeepSense significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all three tasks. In addition, we show that DeepSense is feasible to implement on smartphones and embedded devices thanks to its moderate energy consumption and low latency.",2016,529,"2325031, 3225210, 2580112, 2085709, 1730531",2325031,Dublin,2,"143695559, 1402912902",Y,"I found it would have also been interesting and helpful to define and show a new metric that incorporates both accuracy and compression rate into a single metric, e.g., how much accuracy is lost (or gained) per compression rate relatively to the baseline of no compression.;A full implementation of binary CNN with code This paper builds on Binary-NET [Hubara et al. 2016] and expands it to CNN architectures.",The Web Conference,26,"applications,deepsense,noise,data processing,Data Processing"

This paper proposes using the IPFS distributed hash table (DHT) technology to store information immutably and in a decentralized manner to mitigate the high cost of storage. A storage system involving blockchain and other storage systems in concert should be based on immutable data and allow removal of data from malicious users in the DHT. Efficiency is improved by decreasing the overall processing time in the blockchain with the help of DHT technology and introducing an agreement service that communicate with the blockchain via a RESTful API.

While application composition and scheduling on such resources are being explored, there exists a gap in a distributed data storage service on the edge and fog layer, instead depending solely on the cloud for data persistence. Such a service should reliably store and manage data on fog and edge devices, even in the presence of failures, and offer transparent discovery and access to data for use by edge computing applications. Here, we present ElfStore, a first-of-its-kind edge-local federated store for streams of data blocks. It uses reliable fog devices as a super-peer overlay to monitor the edge resources, offers federated metadata indexing using Bloom filters, locates data within 2-hops, and maintains approximate global statistics about the reliability and storage capacity of edges. Edges host the actual data blocks, and we use a unique differential replication scheme to select edges on which to replicate blocks, to guarantee a minimum reliability and to balance storage utilization.

These techniques were largely proposed individually, and, in this work, we seek to use them jointly. To accomplish this task, these techniques need to be thoroughly evaluated individually and their relation better understood. Building on extensive testing, we develop methods to systematically optimize the computation chain together with the underlying bitmatrix. This led to a simple design approach of optimizing the bitmatrix by minimizing a weighted computation cost function, and also a straightforward coding procedure—follow a computation schedule produced from the optimized bitmatrix to apply XOR-level vectorization. This procedure provides better performances than most existing techniques (e.g., those used in ISA-L and Jerasure libraries), and sometimes can even compete against well-known but less general codes such as EVENODD, RDP, and STAR codes. One particularly important observation is that vectorizing the XOR operations is a better choice than directly vectorizing finite field operations, not only because of the flexibility in choosing finite field size and the better encoding throughput, but also its minimal migration efforts onto newer CPUs.",2020,28,"1500391633, 143804003",1500391633,Podgorica,2,"2039003, 2158141874",Y,I feel that the authors should give a more prominent disclaimer to potential users of the test.;Flexible muscle-based locomotion for bipedal creatures.,USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies,20,"techniques,computation,bitmatrix,data storage,Data Storage"

However, such querying is largely restricted to natural language. Typed SQL remains the gold standard for sophisticated structured querying although it is painful in many environments, which restricts when and how users consume their data. In this work, we propose to bridge this gap by designing a speech-driven querying system and interface for structured data we call SpeakQL. We support a practically useful subset of regular SQL and allow users to query in any domain with novel touch/speech based human-in-the-loop correction mechanisms. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) introduces myriad forms of errors in transcriptions, presenting us with a technical challenge. We exploit our observations of SQL's properties, its grammar, and the queried database to build a modular architecture. We present the first dataset of spoken SQL queries and a generic approach to generate them for any arbitrary schema. Our experiments show that SpeakQL can automatically correct a large fraction of errors in ASR transcriptions. User studies show that SpeakQL can help users specify SQL queries significantly faster with a speedup of average 2.7x and up to 6.7x compared to typing on a tablet device.

However, prior streaming systems either focus on stream computation, or are not stateful, or cannot provide low latency and high throughput to handle the fast-evolving linked data and increasing concurrency of queries. This paper presents Wukong+S, a distributed stream querying engine that provides sub-millisecond stateful query at millions of queries per-second over fast-evolving linked data. Wukong+S uses an integrated design that combines the stream processor and the persistent store with efficient state sharing, which avoids the cross-system cost and sub-optimal query plan in conventional composite designs (e.g., Storm/Heron+Wukong). Wukong+S uses a hybrid store to differentially manage timeless data and timing data accordingly and provides an efficient stream index with locality-aware partitioning to facilitate fast access to streaming data. Wukong+S further provides decentralized vector timestamps with bounded snapshot scalarization to scale with nodes and massive queries at efficient memory usage. We have designed Wukong+S conforming to the RDF data model and Continuous SPARQL (C-SPARQL) query interface and have implemented Wukong+S by extending a state-of-the-art static RDF store (namely Wukong).

Unfortunately, the use of such data is very limited due to the huge size of archives (> 500TB) and the limited capabilities of traditional applications. This paper introduces SHAHED; a MapReduce-based system for querying, visualizing, and mining large scale satellite data. SHAHED considers both the spatial and temporal aspects of the data to provide efficient query processing at large scale. The core of SHAHED is composed of four main components. The uncertainty component recovers missing data in the input which comes from cloud coverage and satellite mis-alignment. The indexing component provides a novel multi-resolution quad-tree-based spatio-temporal index structure, which indexes satellite data efficiently with minimal space overhead. The querying component answers selection and aggregate queries in real-time using the constructed index. Finally, the visualization component uses MapReduce programs to generate heat map images and videos for user queries.

We study boundedly evaluable queries under a form of access constraints, when their evaluation cost is determined by the queries and constraints only.

We also provide characterization and effective syntax for their boundedly evaluable queries. When a query Q is not boundedly evaluable, we study two approaches to approximately answering Q under access constraints. (1) We search for upper and lower envelopes of Q that are boundedly evaluable and warrant a constant accuracy bound. (2) We instantiate a minimum set of variables (parameters) in Q such that the specialized query is boundedly evaluable.

The RDF data is cherished and exploited by various domains such as life sciences, Semantic Web, social network, etc. Further, its integration at Web-scale compels RDF management engines to deal with complex queries in terms of both size and structure. In this paper, we propose AMbER (Attributed Multigraph Based Engine for RDF querying), a novel RDF query engine specifically designed to optimize the computation of complex queries. AMbER leverages subgraph matching techniques and extends them to tackle the SPARQL query problem. First of all RDF data is represented as a multigraph, and then novel indexing structures are established to efficiently access the information from the multigraph. Finally a SPARQL query is represented as a multigraph, and the SPARQL querying problem is reduced to the subgraph homomorphism problem. AMbER exploits structural properties of the query multigraph as well as the proposed indexes, in order to tackle the problem of subgraph homomorphism. The performance of AMbER, in comparison with state-of-the-art systems, has been extensively evaluated over several RDF benchmarks.

This data is stored in a publicly available archive for scientists and researchers and is very useful for studying climate, desertification, and land use change. The benefit of this data comes from its richness as it provides an archived history for over 15 years of satellite observations. Unfortunately, the use of such data is very limited due to the huge size of archives (> 500TB) and the limited capabilities of traditional applications. In this demo, we present Shahed, an interactive system which provides an efficient way to index, query, and visualize satellite datasets available in NASA archive. Shahed is composed of four main modules. The uncertainty module resolves data uncertainty imposed by the satellites. The indexing module organizes the data in a novel multi-resolution spatio-temporal index designed for satellite data. The querying module uses the indexes to answer both spatiotemporal selection and aggregate queries provided by the user. The visualization module generates images, videos, and multi-level images which gives an insight of data distribution and dynamics over time.

Taghreed consists of four main components: (1) indexer, (2) query engine, (3) recovery manager, and (4) visualizer. Taghreed indexer efficiently digests incoming microblogs with high arrival rates in light main-memory indexes. When the memory becomes full, the memory contents are flushed to disk indexes which are managing billions of microblogs efficiently. On memory failure, the recovery manager restores the memory contents from backup copies. Taghreed query engine consists of two modules: a query optimizer and a query processor. The query optimizer generates an optimized query plan to be executed by the query processor to provide low query responses. Taghreed visualizer features to its users a wide variety of spatiotemporal queries and presents the answers on a map-based user interface that allows an interactive exploration.

In such cases, the workers are often not able to label the items directly, however, it is reasonable to assume that they can compare items and judge whether they are similar or not. An important question is what queries to make, and we compare two types: random edge queries, where a pair of items is revealed, and random triangles, where a triple is. Since it is far too expensive to query all possible edges and/or triangles, we need to work with partial observations subject to a fixed query budget constraint. When a generative model for the data is available (and we consider a few of these) we determine the cost of a query by its entropy; when such models do not exist we use the average response time per query of the workers as a surrogate for the cost. In addition to theoretical justification, through several simulations and experiments on two real data sets on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we empirically demonstrate that, for a fixed budget, triangle queries uniformly outperform edge queries. Even though, in contrast to edge queries, triangle queries reveal dependent edges, they provide more reliable edges and, for a fixed budget, many more of them. We also provide a sufficient condition on the number of observations, edge densities inside and outside the clusters and the minimum cluster size required for the exact recovery of the true adjacency matrix via triangle queries using a convex optimization-based clustering algorithm.",2016,45,"40275640, 1736279",40275640,Berlin,2,"2115338656, 2086632521",Y,It is also simple and easy to understand.;This section could be improved by demonstrating the approach on more datasets.,Neural Information Processing Systems,16,"items,queries,query,data querying,Data Querying"
