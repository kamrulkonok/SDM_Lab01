We present our results and findings, which include that just 13% of papers had (i) sufficiently low barriers to reproduction, and (ii) enough obtainable information, to be considered for reproduction, and that all but one of the experiments we selected for reproduction was discovered to have flaws that made the meaningfulness of conducting a reproduction questionable. As a result, we had to change our coordinated study design from a reproduce approach to a standardise-then-reproduce-twice approach. Our overall (negative) finding that the great majority of human evaluations in NLP is not repeatable and/or not reproducible and/or too flawed to justify reproduction, paints a dire picture, but presents an opportunity for a rethink about how to design and report human evaluations in NLP.",2023,20,"[41052836.0, 2122535749.0, 2113922820.0, 17038002.0, 2151319597.0, 9364658.0, 3159752.0, 2648584.0, 40684993.0, 10708829.0, 72115354.0, 2544049.0, 2620186.0, 1720986506.0, 1700894.0, 2921637.0, 2215866480.0, 2022288.0, 2165661802.0, 119804885.0, 1380281888.0, 3201315.0, 66376493.0, 50521235.0, 3192572.0, 2142159995.0, 2221260.0, 2921990.0, 2742475.0, 2326758.0, 2201327940.0, 1681799.0, 2150388522.0, 2086973507.0, 2065048323.0, 9714242.0, 9092408.0, 145148787.0, 2143919864.0]",41052836.0,Reykjavik,First Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in NLP,23.0,"['reproduction', 'evaluations', 'study', 'nlp', 'NLP']"

We compared them against general-domain and other domain-specific models for Spanish on three clinical NER tasks. As main results, our models are superior across the NER tasks, rendering them more convenient for clinical NLP applications. Furthermore, our findings indicate that when enough data is available, pre-training from scratch is better than continual pre-training when tested on clinical tasks, raising an exciting research question about which approach is optimal.

When designing quantum algorithms for such a distributed quantum computer, one can make use of the added parallelization and distribution abilities inherent in the system. An added difficulty to then overcome for distributed quantum computing is that a complex control system to orchestrate the various components is required. In this work, we aim to address these issues. We explicitly define what it means for a quantum algorithm to be distributed and then present various quantum algorithms that fit the definition. We discuss potential benefits and propose a high-level scheme for controlling the system. With this, we present our software framework called Interlin-q, a simulation platform that aims to simplify designing and verifying parallel and distributed quantum algorithms. We demonstrate Interlin-q by implementing some of the discussed algorithms using Interlin-q and layout future steps for developing Interlin-q into a control system for distributed quantum computers.",2021,17,"[115799034.0, 2061202877.0, 2042703517.0, 52221692.0]",115799034.0,Oslo,2021 IEEE/ACM Second International Workshop on Quantum Computing Software (QCS),21.0,"['quantum', 'algorithms', 'system', 'quantum computing', 'Quantum Computing']"

To rein in this trend, the European Union, in 2018, introduced a comprehensive legislation called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this paper, we review GDPR from a system design perspective, and identify how its regulations conflict with the design, architecture, and operation of modern systems. We illustrate these conflicts via the seven GDPR sins: storing data forever; reusing data indiscriminately; walled gardens and black markets; risk-agnostic data processing; hiding data breaches; making unexplainable decisions; treating security as a secondary goal. Our findings reveal a deep-rooted tussle between GDPR requirements and how modern systems have evolved. We believe that achieving compliance requires comprehensive, grounds up solutions, and anything short would amount to fixing a leaky faucet in a sinking ship.",2019,51,"[7456408.0, 35752445.0, 2002462.0]",7456408.0,Lisbon,USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing,19.0,"['data', 'gdpr', 'security', 'data processing', 'Data Processing']"

NoSQL documents stores are well tailored to efficiently load and manage large amounts of heterogeneous documents without any prior structure validations or constraints. However, this flexibility becomes a serious challenge while querying data from a heterogeneous collection of documents. Hence, it is mandatory to modify existing queries or add new ones whenever new structures are introduced in the collection. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable transparent querying over a heterogeneous collection of documents. We offer an automatic query enrichment mechanism that benefits from a pre-materialized dictionary gathering different possible underlying document structures. The query enrichment is automated via query operators rewriting algorithms. Also, we refer to a set of experiments to evaluate the performances of our approach over a synthetic datas",2018,9,"[35318166.0, 1702822.0, 1761667.0, 2862341.0]",35318166.0,Bucharest,International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,18.0,"['documents', 'data', 'collection', 'data querying', 'Data Querying']"

We present a revised version of LODeX that provides the user an easy way for building queries in a fast and interactive manner. When a user decides to explore a LOD source, he/she can take advantage of the Schema Summary produced by LODeX (i.e. a synthetic view of the datasetâs structure) and he/she can pick graphical elements from it to create a visual query. The tool also supports the user in browsing the results and, eventually, in refining the query. The prototype has been evaluated on hundreds of public SPARQL endpoints (listed in Data Hub) and it is available online at http://dbgroup.unimo.it/lodex2. A survey conducted on 27 users has demonstrated that our tool can effectively support both unskilled and skilled users in exploring and querying LOD datasets.",2015,20,"[2064746531.0, 2724566.0, 3081813.0]",2064746531.0,Vaduz,International Workshop on the Semantic Web,15.0,"['query', 'lod', 'user', 'data querying', 'Data Querying']"

However, the majority of SPARQL implementations require the data to be available in advance, i.e., to exist in main memory or in a RDF repository (accessible through a SPARQL endpoint). Nonetheless, Linked Data exists in the Web in various forms; even an HTML Web page can contain RDF data through RDFa, or RDF data may be dynamically created by a Web Service. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an extension of SPARQL 1.1, called SPARQL-LD, that allows to directly and flexibly exploit this wealth of data. SPARQL-LD allows to fetch, query and integrate in the same SPARQL query: i) data coming from online RDF or JSON-LD files, ii) data coming from dereferenceable URIs, iii) data embedded in Web pages as RDFa, iv) data that is dynamically created by Web Services, and v) data coming by querying other endpoints. A distinctive characteristic of this extension is that it enables to fetch and query even data in datasets returned by a portion of the query, i.e. discovered at query-execution time.",2015,17,"[2393008.0, 1801959.0]",2393008.0,Bern,International Workshop on the Semantic Web,15.0,"['data', 'sparql', 'query', 'data querying', 'Data Querying']"

Bit coin has demonstrated in the financial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a block chain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bit coin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial -- they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to block chains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.",2015,1895,"[2653464.0, 31945113.0, 1682773.0]",2653464.0,Sarajevo,2015 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops,15.0,"['data', 'users', 'control', 'data querying', 'Data Querying']"
